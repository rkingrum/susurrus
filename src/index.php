            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
                The beauty of nature is never complete without susurrus: the whisper of wind through columns of rock,
                the murmur of water through a stream, and the rustling of leaves far above.  At Susurrus Consulting, we
                strive to bring the same level of completion and beauty to your business or project.  Our goal is to
                take your idea and bring it to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our designers are experienced with taking an existing brand to the next level, or starting from scratch
                and building a truly unique experience.  Since we customize our services for each customer, you can
                feel confident that you will always be more than just a number on a spreadsheet.  We believe in
                building real, personal relationships so that we can fundamentally understand and exceed your specific
                needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Design is just a small part of the equation though.  Our developers are just as involved in every
                decision, ensuring that everything works together behind the scenes.  We know how daunting code can be,
                so our developers work hard at making sure that you understand the big picture and how it affects your
                project.  We also prioritize documentation and strict coding standards, so if you choose to work on our
                code in the future, it should be accessible and easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                After designing and developing your product, you'll need to make sure that it reaches all the right
                people.  Our marketing team understands exactly what it takes to make you the next big thing.  From SEO
                to social media campaigns, we've stayed up with the most current trends and standards so you don't have
                to.  Our priority is bringing your business to life and there's no better way to do that than to foster
                an active and vibrant community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding the best team for the job is hard, so we've taken that step so that you can focus on the big
                feature.  Whether you're convinced or need a bit more information, <a href="#">send us an email</a>!
                We would love to hear from you and figure out if we'd be a good fit.  And even if things don't seem
                quite right, we'll be able to point you in the right direction so that you can bring your vision to
                life.

                        At "For Us, The Living", we strive to make your website come to life.  We believe that websites
                        reflect the heart and soul of their owners.  With over 20 years of combined design work, our
                        designers know exactly how to bring your idea to life.  Whether you're looking for a professional
                        and clean ecommerce platform, or an artsy personal portfolio to make your work pop, our designers

                        Our designers aren't just artists either.  They're well versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so
                        that they can implement their designs directly instead of relying on a middleman to interpret
                        their vision.  Our philosophy is that each member of our team should be directly invested in your
                        project so that not only can we make you happy, but we can be proud of what we've done when we're
                        done.  We would never send something to you that we wouldn't be proud of using ourselves.
