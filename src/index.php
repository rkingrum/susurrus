                    <p>
                        At "For Us, The Living", we strive to make your website come to life.  We believe that websites
                        reflect the heart and soul of their owners.  With over 20 years of combined design work, our
                        designers know exactly how to bring your idea to life.  Whether you're looking for a professional
                        and clean ecommerce platform, or an artsy personal portfolio to make your work pop, our designers
                        have the knowledge to make your dream a reality.

                        Our designers aren't just artists either.  They're well versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so
                        that they can implement their designs directly instead of relying on a middleman to interpret
                        their vision.  Our philosophy is that each member of our team should be directly invested in your
                        project so that not only can we make you happy, but we can be proud of what we've done when we're
                        done.  We would never send something to you that we wouldn't be proud of using ourselves.
